    "backquote": "Because each of our journeys has been different, there are colors that only you can bring forth. Even if it's an activity that already exists in society, it will naturally take on different hues due to the local context in which it's practiced and your unique character as the practitioner.\n\nStarting from 'me', the individual colors of each person remain independent while gently overlapping. Instead of saying 'You're troubled by this, you're totally different from me', it's about feeling a connection somewhere, resonating, and being able to join hands even as we move towards different things.",
