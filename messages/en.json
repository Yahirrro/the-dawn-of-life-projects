    "backquote": "Because each of our journeys has been different, you have a unique color that only you can produce. Even if it's an activity that already exists in the world, it will naturally take on a different hue due to the local context in which it's conducted and your personality as the one conducting it.\n\nSuch colors that begin with 'me' remain independent while gently overlapping. Instead of thinking 'You're bothered by this, that's completely different from me,' we can feel that it resonates with us somewhere, empathize, and join hands even as we move in different directions.",
