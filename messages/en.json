    "backquote": "Because each of our journeys has been different, you have a unique color that only you can produce. Even if it's an activity that already exists in the world, it will naturally take on a different hue due to the local context in which it operates and your own personality as the one carrying it out.\n\nSuch colors, originating from each individual 'me,' remain distinct while gently overlapping. Instead of thinking 'You're bothered by this, that's completely different from me,' we can feel a connection somewhere, resonate, and join hands even as we move in different directions.",
    "quotefrom": "From 'Creative Democracy Beginning with 'Me'",
    "aboutmessage": "In THE DAWN OF LIFE PROJECTS, we, the fourth-year students of the Iwasaki Seminar, will showcase a part of the process of our graduation projects that we are working on towards graduation."
